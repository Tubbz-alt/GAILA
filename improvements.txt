I should make more things configurable. Maybe inside of inverses, I'll have info on each reporter. Change the name of the folder from inverse to reporter, and have TMT10.inv, TMT10.info, etc. 

Most importantly, I need better validation. And I need to use a better thing than os.system, because that's super dangerous and bad form.
