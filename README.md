# LOBEL_GUI_FINAL


## FOR WINDOWS

### Prerequisites:
#### Download python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
(Click "Windows x86-64 MSI installer" if you have 64 bit windows, and "Windows x86 MSI installer" if you have 32 bit windows (all newer computers run 64 bit windows))
Then follow installation instructions

#### Make sure Perl is installed:
http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
(Click "Download ActivePerl for Windows (64-bit, x64)" if you have 64 bit windows, and "Download ActivePerl for Windows (x86)" if you have 32 bit windows (all newer computers run 64 bit windows))

#### Download Microsoft Visual C++ compiler: 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
Then run the .msi installer to install


### INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are downloaded, download this folder by clicking the "download ZIP" button near the top-right of this page. Unzip this zip file, and move the created folder to a location of your choice. 

After unzipping, you should be able to set up the project by clicking on install.bat, located in the INSTALLATION folder. This file automatically downloads dependencies, including pip (a python package manager), virtualEnv (a python dependency), as well as various python packages (flask, numpy, pandas).


### TO RUN
The installation creates a file called startup.bat. Double click this file to run the server. 

To use the the program, open your web browser (firefox or chrome) and type localhost:5000 into the URL bar. If the server is running correctly, you should see the User Interface for our GPM and MGF-parsing scripts.

## FOR Mac
Unfortunately, an installation script hasn't been written for macs quite yet, but one is coming.

### If the installation doesn't work, or you have any questions about how to use the interface, you can contact me at samuel.lobel@gmail.com
